      <p>The Kiss (in German Der Kuss) is an oil-on-canvas painting with added gold leaf,
        silver and platinum. by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt. It was
        painted at some point in 1907 and 1908, during the height of what scholars call
        his "Golden Period". It was exhibited in 1908 under the title Liebespaar
        (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The painting depicts
        a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful robes
        decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the
        organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The painting now hangs in the
        Ã–sterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered
         a masterpiece of Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and Klimt's most
         popular work.</p>
