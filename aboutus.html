      <p>We want to introduce some picture to you.
        <br>Art is a diverse range of (and products of) human activities
        involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency,
        beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.<br>
        There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,
        and ideas have changed over time. The three classical branches of visual art are painting,
        sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts,
        as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media,
        are included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the 17th century,
        art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences.
        In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount,
        the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in
        general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>
